 Contains classes that emulate powersupplies by
 building off the Device framework
 
 == Power Supply class ==
 by Aidan Macdonald (aidan.plenert.macdonald@gmail.com) 

 General model of a basic Power Supply
 
* Initialization PowerSupply(volt, current)
 Creates a framework for a Powersupply, but only binds
 a reset call to "RST?". All other functions have been
 left unbound so that children can bind them to respective
 commands

 voltage and current default to 10

* reset(pty, args)
 returns that the device has been reset

* version(pty, args)
 overrides the version function from superclass
 left unbound here, because it was bound in the
 superclass.

* on(pty, args)
 turns power supply on

* off(pty, args)
 turns power supply off

* getVoltage(pty, args)
 returns voltage

* getCurrent(pty, args)
 returns current

* setVoltage(pty, args)
 sets voltage

* setCurrent(pty, args)
 sets current


 == E3631A Power Supply Class ==
 by Aidan Macdonald (aidan.plenert.macdonald@gmail.com)
 
 Emulates the E3631A Power Supply
 
* Initialization - E3631A(voltage, current)
 see PowerSupply.PowerSupply documentation
 
 adds bindings for all of the PowerSupply functions

* version(pty, args)
 returns version

* outp(pty, args)
 function binding for the "OUTP" command
 Used to turn the device on and off
