A GPIB Instrument Emulator written to receive and respond to commands given to a generated PTY device under a Unix Environment.

Originally developed to emulate commands given to a Prologix GPIB-USB Controller (prologix.biz) and return the sample responses.

Written in Python, it can, and will be, extended to emulate many different devices that accessed via GPIB.

If you would like to have support added for a specific device, please contact me and I would be happy to add support for your device.
