 **** Prologix_GPIB_USB Class ****

 A Device that emulates the functionality of the
 Prologix GPIB-USB Controller (prologix.biz)
 
%% Initialization - Prologix_GPIB_USB()
 Does not take arguments, but is VERY important
 All classes that attempt to inherit this class,
 must call this initialization.

 This creates a dictionary containing all the commands
 to be run. If this dictionary is not created, this class
 does nothing

%% handleCMD(pty_interface, command, arguments)
 See Device.handleCMD documentation

 In Prologix_GPIB_USB, this function makes use of the
 map made in initialization to find the command and
 its associated handler, then call the handler and pass in
 the pty_interface and the arguments

%% version(pty, args)
 Returns the device version

%% addr(pty, args)
 If no arguments are given, returns the current address
 of the pty interface

 if args are given, then an integer is parsed out of
 the first argument and set as the address. This ensures
 that a device exists at the following address

 Any errors return "ERROR"

%% kill(pty, args)
 Stops the pty interface from running
     
%% addCMD(command, handler_function)
 Adds a command to the dictionary
 Handler function must be of the form
 func(pty_interface, arguments):
